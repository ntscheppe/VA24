**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left

**Minor Parties that are not gona make it into parliament**
By popular request I added the other parties that are on the ballot but are so small that they will not manage to get to 4% for seats:

* The ever (un)popular: Communist Party of Austria Plus
* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots
* A party for christians, that is not the ÖVP: Christian Party of Austria
* A party that is literally called: Every Vote Counts
* A party that has left in their name twice to be more obvious: Socialist Left Party

**Current Poll:**

https://imgur.com/a/WKvZSWD

ÖVP - 34,0% (+2,5%)

FPÖ - 20,2% (-5,8%)

SPÖ - 22,3% (-4,6%)

NEOS - 8,2% (+2,9%)

JETZT - 2,8% (-2,6%)

GRÜNE - 12,2% (+8,4%)

This was a quick summary of the elections, first results will be in at 17:00 CEST and those will be already pretty complete and we will have a really good idea on how to election went at 18:00 CEST. Final results will be published on Monday due to mail ballots only being opened on Monday.

**Possible Coalitions**

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options: 
* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.

This was a quick summary of the elections, first results will be in at 17:00 CEST and those will be already pretty complete and we will have a really good idea on how to election went at 18:00 CEST. Final results will be published on Monday due to mail ballots only being opened on Monday.

**Possible Coalitions**

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options: 
* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.

Ibiza enquiry ends early - and puts Chancellor Sebastian Kurz in the dock
Austria's parliament ends the work of the Ibiza Committee. It has uncovered a badly damaged rule of law.

As absurd as it sounds, Heinz-Christian Strache would have earned a medal for the Republic's merits. Without the ex-party leader of the right-wing FPÖ, who in 2017 was secretly filmed in a holiday villa on Ibiza as vice-chancellor-to-be, as he submitted alcohol-soaked power fantasies and corruption deals to an alleged oligarch's daughter, Austrians would not know today what a battered state their state is in.

Because without this ""b'soffene G'schicht"" (quote Strache - drunken story), there would not be the Ibiza enquiry committee with the subtitle ""concerning alleged purchasability of the Turkish-blue federal government"".

Strache's racketeering, however, became a minor matter in the course of the investigation. Instead, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz and his People's Party ÖVP became the focus of the justice system. The young chancellor, soon to be 35 years old and a father-to-be, has since faced a major test for the first time after his dizzying rise to become the youngest EU head of government. It is quite possible that he will not pass it.

For the record so far of the Ibiza investigation, which ends prematurely today, could not be more devastating. Kurz is Austria's first chancellor since 1945 to be charged with making false statements. And his ÖVP looks like a felt of power arrogance and nepotism.

The chat that convicted the chancellor

A prime example of Kurz's machinations was the appointment of Thomas Schmid as the new head of the board of the state holding company Öbag, which manages the Republic's shares in listed companies. During his appearance before the Ibiza Committee, Kurz said he had been informed about Schmid's application but had not actively intervened. He was unable to recall anything in response to questions about the case a total of 88 times: ""To be honest, I have no perception of this,"" was his standard answer.

The opposition Ibiza committee members did not buy that. After all, Thomas Schmid was not a stranger, but the Secretary General in the Ministry of Finance, whose incumbent Gernot Blümel is in turn Kurz's closest confidant.

And lo and behold: the chats seized by the public prosecutor's office confirm Kurz's personal involvement in the case: ""You get everything you want anyway,"" the chancellor wrote to Schmid. ""Don't worry, you're family,"" Finance Minister Blümel let his colleague Schmid know - which earned the ÖVP more than one mafia comparison in the Austrian media. ""I love my chancellor,"" minion Schmid thanked Kurz. And Blümel renamed the Öbag straight into ""Schmid-AG"" for internal use.

The whole thing has now ended with criminal proceedings against Kurz on suspicion of corruption. Even at the end of the Ibiza investigation, it is not yet clear when the trial will start. Chancellor Kurz, however, is confident and recently confirmed that he would not resign even in the event of a guilty verdict.

Why the investigation is now being terminated

The defence strategy of the Chancellor and the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP): attack the judiciary, of which Kurz presents himself as a victim. He apparently accepts that he is calling the rule of law into question. For example, the chancellor suspects ""red networks"" in the public prosecutor's office for corruption, without presenting any evidence for this.

Wolfgang Sobotka's statement was even more ludicrous. Sobotka, nota bene, president of the National Council and chairman of the Ibiza Committee, seriously suggested exempting witnesses from the obligation to tell the truth. Critical questions would only ""unsettle them and entangle them in contradictions"".

The fact that Kurz and the ÖVP still have a lot to hide and fear is ultimately proven by the majority decision in parliament to prematurely stall the Ibiza Committee as of 15 July. The co-ruling Greens had to agree with a clenched fist in their pocket. New elections in the midst of an uncertain pandemic would also be inconvenient for Kurz's coalition partners.",5,2021-07-19 04:07:43,0,ÖVP,europe,NEUTRAL,0.5,1.5,"['positive', 0.006985299754887819]","['negative', 0.013721971772611141]","['neutral', 0.9792927503585815]",neutral

**Possible Coalitions**

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options: 
* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left

**Minor Parties that are not gona make it into parliament**
By popular request I added the other parties that are on the ballot but are so small that they will not manage to get to 4% for seats:

* The ever (un)popular: Communist Party of Austria Plus
* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots
* A party for christians, that is not the ÖVP: Christian Party of Austria
* A party that is literally called: Every Vote Counts
* A party that has left in their name twice to be more obvious: Socialist Left Party

The Islamophobic party, which has promised to ban mosques and is calling for a freeze on asylum and a more restrictive immigration policy, is expected to win between 35 and 37 of the 150 seats in the Dutch House of Representatives; it previously held just 16.This map provides an overview of the strength of a selection of parties on the far right of Europe's political spectrum. These political parties have their differences, of course, but can be compared ideologically for, among other things, their strong nationalism and social conservatism.In the EU, several countries have become particularly effective breeding grounds for right-wing extremism. In Poland, the Law and Justice party (PiS) came to power in 2015. In the 2019 parliamentary elections, the PiS-led United Right coalition managed to retain a majority of seats in the Polish Sejm; however, the coalition lost its majority in the October 2023 parliamentary elections. Nevertheless, it remains in front, and the PiS currently holds 37% of seats.In Hungary, Viktor Orbán's Fidesz has already been in power for over ten years, and won a landslide victory in the 2022 parliamentary elections. It currently holds 59% of parliamentary seats and forms a governing coalition with the Christian Democrat NKDP. In Austria, the FPÖ came to power in 2017, but after a sharp decline in the 2019 elections, the party now accounts for just 16% (down from 28% in 2017), a share similar to that achieved by the Rassemblement National after its historic 2022 legislative result in France. In Belgium, the Flemish nationalist party, Vlaams Belang, currently weighs in at 12%, while in Germany, the AfD is down to 11% after losing 11 seats in the 2021 federal elections.

Idontcareokokok,l02kmj,Parliamentary investigation uncovers Europe's far-right plot to establish its own bank to fund itself,,2021-01-18 20:07:20,FPÖ,Idontcareokokok,gjr4nfy,t3_l02kmj,"**How the FPÖ wanted to establish a blue bank**

FPÖ was hoping for a deal until the Ibiza video - Öbag boss Schmid in chat with Strache: ""Bank is on track - knock us in on your cause""

Vienna - The FPÖ has not buried its hope of finding a bank that will finance the party and all other right-wing parliamentary groups in the EU so quickly. The search lasted until shortly before the Ibiza video became known in May 2019, after which the turquoise-blue coalition under Sebastian Kurz (ÖVP) and Heinz-Christian Strache (FPÖ) broke up.


As reported, FPÖ protagonists have counted on the takeover of the Viennese private bank by the Slovak Arca Capital. They wanted to buy the majority from the shareholders Günter Kerbler and Hannes Kowar. Among the owners around the controversial Slovak billionaire Pavol Krúpa, the Freedom Party thought, one would get discrete loans in the millions and Europe's rights could finance their election campaigns. Of course, the banking regulator FMA thwarted the blue bill: It did not allow Arca as the owner, the deal failed in autumn 2018.

Kerbler and Kowar had no idea of ​​any of this, as they say.

Arca was advised by Sigma Investment, for whom Peter Sidlo (former FPÖ district council and later on the casino board) was responsible. In an interview (on the Ibiza case) he testified that he was ""too optimistic"" about the FMA. After the failure of the Arca transaction, they ""tried further"" and the result was an Arca stake of 9.9 percent in the Viennese private bank. He confirmed to the investigators that it was the idea that the FPÖ ""would have received credit lines for the above-mentioned purposes (including voter funding; note) if the takeover was successful"".

Johann Gudenus (FPÖ member of the National Council until May 2019) is also likely to have been interested in bank details. On October 9, 2018, he asked Sidlo ""which banking licenses"" are still available and whether other interested parties would be ""interesting"". Sidlo said it depends on who it is. In his testimony, he stated that they had considered who else would be eligible for the takeover. Sigma was commissioned by Arca until autumn 2019. All of this can be found in documents that DER STANDARD knows.


Gudenus apparently still dealt with the topic in March 2019. At the beginning of March he let his party friend and OeNB General Council member Sidlo know: ""I spoke to Thomas Schmid yesterday about the bank"". At that time, Schmid was still Secretary General in the Ministry of Finance and was about to become the sole director of the state industrial holding Öbag. It landed there on April 1, 2019.


What Gudenus and Schmid had discussed, Sidlo no longer knew what to say in front of the investigators.

Even as Öbag boss Schmid is likely to have dealt with the blue banking issue in some way. In any case, this suggests his message to Vice Chancellor Strache on April 29, 2019: ""Dear HC! Bank is on track - knock us in on your cause"", which Strache said with a ""Thank you!"" answered. What exactly was on track there? Sidlo couldn't explain it to the investigators; his lawyer points out that there is no investigation in the banking connexion.

And what does Öbag boss Schmid say about that? That cannot be determined: despite a number of inquiries, he was not ready to comment. The same goes for Gudenus. And Strache could not be reached either.

Sigma boss Markus Braun, like Sidlo before him, was asked by the parliamentary Ibiza-U-Committee about details around the Arca-Wiener private bank-topic by the Green-mandate Nina Tomaselli. For example, she wanted to know if there would have been a two percent contingency fee - if the deal had worked. Braun, Sidlo's brother-in-law and functionary in various FPÖ-related clubs that he does not see as FPÖ-related, was very eloquent in his questioning, but was rather taciturn on this topic. He found it ""touching that you are so interested in high finance,"" he once said, but referred to banking secrecy for details. In addition, the topic has nothing to do with the subject of investigation, as he said.

Verhofstadt,ur3x1s,Germany poll,,2022-05-16 19:29:38,FPÖ,entotron,i8vseu4,t1_i8vouo1,"This is very true. Funnily enough, infighting and ideological splits have been a very important factor in the FPÖ's history (and rise to prominence). Just like you mentioned. First Heide Schmidt left under Haider to found the Liberales Forum which later evolved/merged into the current NEOS (liberals), effectively purging the ""Wirtschaftsliberale""  (economic liberals/libertarians) from the party.

Then after the coalition between the FPÖ and the conservatives imploded and Haider lost a lot of public and party support, his long term disciple Heinz-Christian Strache turned on him, rose to power inside the FPÖ (which made Haider leave) and took the party from a more populist, anti-establishment, anti-immigration and soft euroskeptic platform into a full on Austrian-nationalist, anti-EU, anti-Islam and almost [Christian nationalist](https://imgl.krone.at/scaled/1636654/v7cf00e/full.jpg) direction. In other words, he made the party more extreme in its ideology. Consider for example that Haider was open to EU accession negotiations with Turkey while Strache was one of the people who very early on (two decades ago) coined the phrases ""Turkey is not Europe"" and ""Islam does not belong to Europe"". Two very popular phrases in this very subreddit mind you (yes, I'm looking at you, mods..). The same Strache also signed a [""cooperation pact""](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-austria-farright-russia-idUSKBN1481MJ) with Putin's United Russia and constantly praised Donald Trump.

Finally, after Strache flew too close to the sun and burned like his former mentor, there was a similar power struggle between the more measured Norbert Hofer (who almost won the Austrian federal presidency a few years prior) and the hardcore nationalist Herbert Kickl, who eventually won and took over.

Kickl is probably one of the most Trumpian politicians we ever had in Austria and even disgusting by FPÖ standards. I genuinely hope that he'll destroy what the populists before him built because of his incompetence and stupidity. But there is a non-zero chance that instead, he'll drag the FPÖ voters even further to the right with him.",3,2022-05-16 23:23:12,0,FPÖ,europe,POSITIVE,1.0,2.0,"['positive', 0.7839586138725281]","['negative', 0.182212695479393]","['neutral', 0.0338287428021431]",positive

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left

**Minor Parties that are not gona make it into parliament**
By popular request I added the other parties that are on the ballot but are so small that they will not manage to get to 4% for seats:

* The ever (un)popular: Communist Party of Austria Plus
* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots
* A party for christians, that is not the ÖVP: Christian Party of Austria
* A party that is literally called: Every Vote Counts
* A party that has left in their name twice to be more obvious: Socialist Left Party

NEOS - 8,2% (+2,9%)

JETZT - 2,8% (-2,6%)

GRÜNE - 12,2% (+8,4%)

This was a quick summary of the elections, first results will be in at 17:00 CEST and those will be already pretty complete and we will have a really good idea on how to election went at 18:00 CEST. Final results will be published on Monday due to mail ballots only being opened on Monday.

**Possible Coalitions**

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options: 
* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.

The state elections in Germany carry a somewhat higher importance, since Germany is a federation, and they can affect the national government, since the upper chamber of the parliament - *Bundesrat* (Federal Council) represents the 16 states of Germany and the members are generally members of the state governments. Laws that affect state powers and constitutional changes require the consent of both chambers. The state elections can also be considered a referendum on the national government - if the opposition has a majority in *Bundesrat*, the government might have troubles passing laws through it.

I shall leave detailed commentary (and any interesting trivia!) on elections and campaign, to our German users, or anyone else with worthy knowledge. Feel free to correct or add anything!

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left

**Minor Parties that are not gona make it into parliament**
By popular request I added the other parties that are on the ballot but are so small that they will not manage to get to 4% for seats:

* The ever (un)popular: Communist Party of Austria Plus
* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots
* A party for christians, that is not the ÖVP: Christian Party of Austria
* A party that is literally called: Every Vote Counts
* A party that has left in their name twice to be more obvious: Socialist Left Party

**Current Poll:**

https://imgur.com/a/WKvZSWD

ÖVP - 34,0% (+2,5%)

FPÖ - 20,2% (-5,8%)

SPÖ - 22,3% (-4,6%)

NEOS - 8,2% (+2,9%)

JETZT - 2,8% (-2,6%)

GRÜNE - 12,2% (+8,4%)

This was a quick summary of the elections, first results will be in at 17:00 CEST and those will be already pretty complete and we will have a really good idea on how to election went at 18:00 CEST. Final results will be published on Monday due to mail ballots only being opened on Monday.

**Possible Coalitions**

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options: 
* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.
